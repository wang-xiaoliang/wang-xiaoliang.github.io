* ### Mobile Cloud Computing for Pervasive Healthcare

<img src="/images/MCC_Health.png" alt="Mobile Cloud Computing for Pervasive Healthcare" hspace="40">

<div><p class="ex1"><font size="3">Recent advances on wearable and mobile technologies have made 
mobile devices a promising tool to manage patients' own health status and assessment 
through services like telemedicine. However, the inherent limitations 
of mobile devices make them less effective and sustainable in computation- or data-intensive 
tasks such as physiological monitoring and analysis. Cloud computing embraces new opportunities 
of transforming healthcare delivery into a more reliable and endurable manner. As the development and 
adoption of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) techniques in healthcare, 
we explored and studied new optimization strategies to help mobile cloud healthcare services to be deployed in a more effective and efficient manner. 
It was showed that our proposed approach can 
significantly enhance the conventional mobile-based health monitoring 
in terms of diagnostic accuracy, execution efficiency and energy efficiency.</font></p></div>

* ### Diabetic Retinopathy Stage Classification Based on Fundoscopic Image Analysis

<img src="/images/DR.png" alt="Diabetic Retinopathy Stage Classification" hspace="40">

<div><p class="ex1"><font size="3">Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) stage classification has been regarded as a critical step for evaluation and management of diabetes retinopathy. 
Because of damages of the retina blood vessels caused by the high blood glucose level, different extent of microstructures, 
such as micro-anuerysms, hard exudates, and neovascularization, could occupy the retina area. Deep learning based 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has recently been proved a promising approach in biomedical image analysis. 
In our work, representative Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) images have been aggregated into five categories according 
to the expertise of ophthalmologist. Various deep Convolutional Neural Network methods have been employed 
for DR stage classification. State-of-the-art accuracy result has been achieved, 
which demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing deep Convolutional Neural Networks for DR image recognition.</font></p></div>

<div><p class="ex1"><font size="3">The Internet of Things (IoT) is the extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. 
Embedded with electronics, Internet connectivity, and other forms of hardware (such as sensors), these devices can communicate and interact 
with others over the Internet, and they can be remotely monitored and controlled. We developed various cyber-physical systems and leveraged machine learning based
data-driven approach to provide smart surveillance services.</font></p></div>
